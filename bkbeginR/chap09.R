# This chapter builds on the previous one. Now that you have seen how to define more complex analytical situations, you learn how to make and rearrange your data so that it can be analyzed more easily. This also builds on knowledge gained in Chapter 3. In many cases, when you have carried out an analysis you will need to extract data for certain groups; this chapter also deals with that, giving you more tools that you will need to carry out complex analyses easily.
