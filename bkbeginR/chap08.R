# Chapter -8 : Formal Notation and Complex Statistics ####

# What you will learn in this chapter
# 
# How to use formula notation for simple hypothesis tests
# How to use formula notation in graphics
# How to carry out analysis of variance (ANOVA)
# How to conduct post-hoc tests
# How the formula syntax can be used to define complex analytical models
# How to carry out complex ANOVA
# How to draw summary graphs of ANOVA
# How to create interaction plots
# As your analyses become more complex, you need a more complex way to tell R what you want to do. This chapter is concerned with an important element of R: how to define complex situations. The chapter has two main parts; the first part shows how the formula notation can be used with simple situations. The second part uses an important analytical method, analysis of variance, as an illustration. The rest of the chapter is devoted to ANOVA. This is an important chapter because the ability to define complex analytical situations is something you will inevitably require at some point.
