# Chapter -10 : Regression and Linear Modeling ####
# 
# What you will learn in this chapter
# 
# How to carry out linear regression (including multiple regression)
# How to carry out curvilinear regression using logarithmic and polynomials as examples
# How to build a regression model using both forward and backward stepwise processes
# How to plot regression models
# How to add lines of best-fit to regression plots
# How to determine confidence intervals for regression models
# How to plot confidence intervals
# How to draw diagnostic plots
# This chapter is all about regression. It builds on earlier chapters and covers various aspects of this important analytical method. You learn how to carry out basic regression as well as complex model building and curvilinear regression. It is also important because it illustrates some useful aspects of R (for example, how to dissect results). The later parts of the chapter deal with graphical aspects of regression, such as how to add lines of best-fit and confidence intervals.
