#Assignment - 6 

# create a vector of 40 values at equal interval between 10 and 200; use integer values


# use this vector to Create the matrix 5 x 8 : columnwise


# Return the product of each of the rows


# Return the sum of each of the columns


# Return a new matrix whose entries are those of 'matrix' modulo 10


# How many odd nos each column has



# View the data set iris
# get the mean of the first 4 variables, by species



# Environment
# create a new environment
e <- new.env()
# two environment variables, a - matrix and b as an array
e$a <- matrix(1:12,nrow=4)
e$b <- array(c(1:3*4*2),dim=c(3,4,2))
# Find the mean of the variables

#check the class of each object



# create a list with 2 elements 1:20 and 55:100 and mpg and weight coln of mtcars dataset

# Find the sum of the values in each element

# print the values in Vector form
